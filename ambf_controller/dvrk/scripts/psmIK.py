# THIS IS THE IK FOR THE PSM MOUNTED WITH THE LARGE NEEDLE DRIVER TOOL. THIS IS THE
# SAME KINEMATIC CONFIGURATION FOUND IN THE DVRK MANUAL. NOTE, JUST LIKE A FAULT IN THE
# MTM's DH PARAMETERS IN THE MANUAL, THERE IS A FAULT IN THE PSM's DH AS WELL. CHECK THE FK
# FILE TO FIND THE CORRECT DH PARAMS BASED ON THE FRAME ATTACHMENT IN THE DVRK MANUAL

# ALSO, NOTICE THAT AT HOME CONFIGURATION THE TIP OF THE PSM HAS THE FOLLOWING
# ROTATION OFFSET W.R.T THE BASE. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR IK PURPOSES.
# R_7_0 = [ 0,  1,  0 ]
#       = [ 1,  0,  0 ]
#       = [ 0,  0, -1 ]
# Basically, x_7 is along y_0, y_7 is along x_0 and z_7 is along -z_0.

# Read the frames, positions and rotation as follows, T_A_B, means that this
# is a Transfrom of frame A with respect to frame B. Similarly P_A_B is the
# Position Vector of frame A's origin with respect to frame B's origin. And finally
# R_A_B is the rotation matrix representing the orientation of frame B with respect to
# frame A.

# If you are confused by the above description, consider the equations below to make sense of it
# all. Suppose we have three frames A, B and C. The following equations will give you the L.H.S

# 1) T_C_A = T_B_A * T_C_B
# 2) R_A_C = inv(R_B_A * R_C_B)
# 3) P_C_A = R_B_A * R_C_B * P_C

# For Postions, the missing second underscore separated quantity means that it is expressed in local
# coodinates. Rotations, and Transforms are always to defined a frame w.r.t to some
# other frame so this is a special case for only positions. Consider the example

# P_B indiciates a point expressed in B frame.

# Now there are two special cases that are identified by letter D and N. The first characeter D indiciates a
# difference (vector) of between two points, specified by the first and second underscore separater (_) strings,
# expressed in the third underscore separated reference. I.e.

# D_A_B_C
# This means the difference between Point A and  B expressed in C. On the other hand the letter N indicates
# the direction, and not specifically the actually
# measurement. So:
#
# N_A_B_C
#
# is the direction between the difference of A and B expressed in C.
