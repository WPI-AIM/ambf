### README

Examples on how to use these files.

The two executable files in the folder are:

1. `gripper_control_via_device_ifc.py`
2. `gripper_control_via_client_ifc.py`

# 1. Gripper Control Via Device Interface

This file leverages the MTM Device interface implemented in the core of
AMBF to trick it to think that there is an MTM connected to the system.
This is where the driver is defined

```
ambf/external/chai3d/src/devices/CdVRKDevices.h
ambf/external/chai3d/src/devices/CdVRKDevices.cpp
```

This control uses a combination of the Base and Tip Transforms as
defined in the `CdVRKDevices.cpp` and well as the Base Frame of the dVRK MTM
that are set in the sawIntuitiveResearchKit MTM code.
Therefore you would not expect it to follow the coordinate system of AMBF but it
matches the AMBF coordinate system when using the actual dVRK MTMs. That being
said, you can tweak the Base and Tip frames in either the `CdVRKDevices.cpp`
file or handle them in the python file in the folder called `proxy_device.py`

See the following lines

```python
if arm_name == 'MTMR':
        self._mtm_arm_type = 0
        self.base_frame.M = Rotation.RPY((-1.57079 - 0.6), 3.14, 0)
        self.tip_frame.M = Rotation.RPY(-3.14, 0, 1.57079)
    elif arm_name == 'MTML':
        self._mtm_arm_type = 1
        self.base_frame.M = Rotation.RPY((-1.57079 - 0.6), 3.14, 0)
        self.tip_frame.M = Rotation.RPY(-3.14, 0, 1.57079)
```

Note: You shall have to account for all the transformation already applied via
the dVRK MTMs sawIntuitiveResearchKit code and the CdVRKDevices.cpp to cancel
the effect. However, this is not the topic of discussion for this section.

You can test this example as follows

1. First, run the python file

```
cd gripper_control_examples
python gripper_control_via_device_ifc.py
```

You shall see a GUI popup with sliders to control x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw and
gripper open and close slider.

2. Then run the AMBF Simulator with the ADF file of your choice. We are going to
use a surgical training puzzle scene in this example.
```
cd ambf/bin/<os>
./ambf_simulator -l16
```

3. Since we are tricking the device driver to think that an MTM is connected to
the system, you shall see that the AMBF simulator automatically spawns a gripper
representing the MTM device. The gripper to be loaded can be set in the
following file:

```
ambf/ambf_models/descriptions/input_devices/input_devices.yaml
```

See the following snippet for dVRK MTMR. The field called simulated multibody
is the ADF file (gripper multibody) that is loaded. You can open that specific
multibody to examine its contents.

``` python
MTMR:
  hardware name: MTMR
  haptic gain: {linear: 0.03, angular: 1}
  workspace scaling: 5
  simulated multibody: "../multi-bodies/grippers/pr2 gripper small red.yaml"
  # root link:
  location: {
    position: {x: -0.5, y: 0, z: 0},
    orientation: {r: 0, p: 0, y: 0}}
  button mapping: {
    a1: 1,
    a2: 2,
    next mode: 3,
    prev mode: 4}
  pair cameras: [camera1, camera2] # The motion of the IID-SDE is w.r.t the first camera in the list
```

4. This gripper can now be controlled via the GUI
that spawned from step 1.

# 2. Gripper Control Via Client Interface
This is the probably the better and more programmatic way to control a gripper
if you are using an algorithm and don't want to bother with hidden implementations
and frame transformations.

In this example, we are going to be relying on the features of the AMBF client
which are meant for generic control puroses.

1. Since we are not using the AMBF Device interface, we shall have to spawn
the gripper in the simulation manually. To do this, we can just add its multibody
at launch. For this example, we can use one of the grippers found here

```
ambf/ambf_models/descriptions/multi-bodies/grippers/pr2 gripper.yaml
```

```
cd ambf/bin/<os>
./ambf_simulator -l 16 -a ambf/ambf_models/descriptions/multi-bodies/grippers/pr2 gripper.yaml
```

You should see the simulation with the puzzle and the gripper just laying there.

2. Now run the following python code.

```
cd gripper_control_examples
python gripper_control_via_client_ifc.py
```

A GUI similar to the one in the previous control example will popup. You can use the sliders
and gripper button to move the gripper and open and close it. This Example uses
the default coordinate frame of AMBF so it is easier to adopt in your code.

3. You will find that in the gripper multibody file (ADF file)
`ambf/ambf_models/descriptions/multi-bodies/grippers/pr2 gripper.yaml` we have
defined a proximity sensor and a constraint actuator. You can inspect the code
in the file `gripper_control_via_client_ifc.py` as well. As you shall find out,
we are manually checking if a sensor is triggered, and if it is triggered,
we get the name of the body that is sensed and then use this sensed body's name in
the actuator to attach the body to the actuator.
